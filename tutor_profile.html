          <div class = "par">My name is Lei Lou Dao. I have a Master of Business administration (MBA) qualification. I also have a TEFL certification in my resume. I love to communicate. I like to spread knowledge to those that I come across, provided if you love to learn. I have been involved in the education industry, from pre school to higher education for almost 25 years.To teach is a passion and a calling. It is not a job.
            <br>Besides the Mandarin language, I can speak in Englih, Bahasa Malaysia and Hokkien fluently. I can also write in Chinese and Bahasa Malaysia fairly well.
            <br>I hope more of you will get to know me better to know who I really am.</div>
